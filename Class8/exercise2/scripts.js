    What is the initial goal of this file?

**Aim**: Create a function that takes a string as input, capitalizes a letter if its ASCII code is even, and returns its lower case version if its ASCII code is odd.

_Examples_

```js
asciiCapitalize("to be or not to be!")    ➞    "To Be oR NoT To Be!"

asciiCapitalize("THE LITTLE MERMAID")    ➞    "THe LiTTLe meRmaiD"

asciiCapitalize("Oh what a beautiful morning.")    ➞    "oH wHaT a BeauTiFuL moRNiNg."
```

---




    What is the version of this file?
        1.0

    If the version is > 1 , has the goal changed? Explain. Why are we here again?
